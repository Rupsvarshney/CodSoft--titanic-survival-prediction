# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This repository contains the implementation of a **Titanic Survival Prediction** model as part of my Data Science internship at **CodSoft**. The project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Using the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), this project explores predictive analytics by determining which passengers survived based on features like age, sex, class, and more.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict whether a given passenger survived the Titanic disaster (binary classification: survived or not survived) using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Data Description
The dataset includes the following key features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available)
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The target variable is **Survived** (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).

## 🚀 Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand data distribution and handle missing values.
   - Visualize survival trends using features like age, gender, and passenger class.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
